/* Define a function `getLetterFrequencies()` that takes in a single string as 
   an argument. The function should *return* an Object whose keys are characters
   (letters) and whose values are the number of times that character appears in
   the argument. Your function should be case sensitive.
   _Hint:_ start with an empty Object, then loop through the letters one at a
   time (you can access them with bracket notation, like with an array). For 
   each letter, increase the value associated with that key by one. Watch out 
   for if the letter is not in the Object yet!
   You can test this method with a word like "Mississippi". */
